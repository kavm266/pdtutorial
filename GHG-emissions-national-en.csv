"Note: Data are presented as rounded figures. However, all calculations have been performed using unrounded data. The national indicator tracks 7 greenhouse gases released by human activity: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulphur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons and nitrogen trifluoride. Emission levels for some years have been revised in light of improvements to estimation methods and availability of new data. Emissions and removals from the land use, land use change and forestry sector (LULUCF) are excluded from national totals. For information on Canada's projected GHG emissions up to 2030, please consult the Progress towards Canada's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target indicator (www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/environmental-indicators/progress-towards-canada-greenhouse-gas-emissions-reduction-target.html).",
